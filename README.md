# CubeX: Cubic exact solutions for the estimation of pairwise haplotype frequencies

CubeX is a python CGI and standalone script for the estimation of pairwise haplotype frequncies for biallelic genetic variants. The [original paper in BMC Bioinformatics](http://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2105-8-428) provides detail on the mathematics underlying this approach.

### [CubeX online webapp](http://apps.biocompute.org.uk/cubex/)

## Code

- cubex_web contains the cgi script and an html form (plus associated image)
- cubex-cl.py is the standalone python script that can be run at the command line
